## Dataset

The data consisted of approximately 2.29M shared bike rides from June 2018 through May 2019 in bay area. The attributes included the trip duration, start/end time, start/end location, and user information such as gender, user type and user age. The dataset can be found in the website: https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that the monthly average utilization of shared bike was about 178K. However, the actual utilization had huge differences month by month. For exemple, the total utilization in March 2019 was almost doubled compared with the total utilization in December 2018.

There were two types of users: subscribers and customers. Subscribers were more likely to use the shared bikes during weekdays, especially during 7am - 9am and 4pm - 7pm. This was probably because most of users used the shared bikes for commuting. However, for random customers, they used bikes both during weekdays and weekends. During weekdays, most of rides were initiated during 7am - 9am and 4pm - 7pm, and during weekends, most of bikes were rent during 10am - 4pm by customers.

Trip durations were also different between subscribers and customers. Customers were more likely to ride the bikes for longer time, especially during weekends.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the shared bike utilizations during June 2018 and May 2019. I start by introducint the different utilizations month by month, and hourly usage in a week. Afterwards, I divide the data into two groups: rides by subscribers and rides by customers. And then I explain what is the difference on daily utilizations between this two groups. Finally, I introduce trip duration by each user type.
